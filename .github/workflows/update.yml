            A new release of
            [@octokit/webhooks-definitions](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks)
            was just released 👋🤖


            This pull request updates the TypeScript definitions derived from
            `@octokit/webhooks-definitions`. I can't tell if the changes are
            fixes, features or breaking, you'll have to figure that out on
            yourself and adapt the commit messages accordingly to trigger the
            right release, see [our commit message
            conventions](https://github.com/octokit/openapi/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#merging-the-pull-request--releasing-a-new-version).
